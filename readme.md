# F-25 Toy Engine

This is a toy engine built on top of the Raylib library for educational and demonstration purposes only. The code is made to be discussed in a classroom setting and sometimes shows practices that are far from optimal. Code is not industrial strength and is not written with performance as a goal. The goal is to demonstrate C++ features good and bad and to provide a roadmap for how students can get started on their own toy engines. It is a sandbox and is probably full of bugs. Enjoy.
